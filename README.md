## autohotkey-aho101

My start in AutoHotKey. This repo will contain many little experiments and lessons with ahk.

### Experiments

#### Search whole `{$projects}` folder for TODO comments marked as global

A CLI command that will get all specially tagged TODO items in all projects in your projects folder.

#### Bookmark link to bookmark folder

Right-click a link on the current page and drag it to a certain bookmarks folder. 
Just like right-clicking a link and choosing the "Bookmark link command but you can choose which folder"
